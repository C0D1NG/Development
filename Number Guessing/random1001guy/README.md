### Number Guessing Game

This is a number guessing game using very basic Javascript, HTML, CSS.
To play this, just download the files in this project/directory and open the index.html file in your browser.
Enjoy!


I created this game with the help of MDN web docs! They are an awesome resource to get started in web development. [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/A_first_splash) check them out!
